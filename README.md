<h3> 🧐 Introduction</h3>
    This project scrapes the amazon gift cards sold on ebay. The purpose is to analyze the percentage of amazon gift cards on ebay which are sold above         face value. I am using python's beautiful soup library to scrape amazon gift cards from ebay.com. For the sake of this project, I have used first 10       pages of amazon gift cards on ebay but it can be scaled to process more gift cards.
    The total number of gift cards being analyzed here are 600.
